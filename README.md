# Tasks API

## Description

This app helps track maintenance work done during the day and is made for two types of users: Managers and Technicians. Technicians can do tasks and only look at, add, or change the tasks they did. Each task includes a detailed description (up to 2500 characters) and the date it was done. 

Managers can see all the tasks done by technicians, remove any tasks, and get notified when a task is completed. This way, managers always know what maintenance work is being done.
